Administrators can create new training events, specify who can attend and whether the event is mandatory or not, and close registration once capacity is reached. Once the app is added to a Teams channel, employees can visit the Discover tab to browse events, register for the ones that interest them, and use the app's message extension to suggest events to their colleagues or direct reports. Once registered, employees receive reminders in Teams, so they never miss an event!"
